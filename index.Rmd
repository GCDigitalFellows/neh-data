The *Visualizing NEH& project is part of a collaboration of the [Graduate Center Digital Fellows](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/). The recently proposed budget by the Trump administration calls for the elimination of the National Endowment of Humanities (NEH) and the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA).

All the code for this project are available on Github at [GCDigitalFellows/visualizing-neh](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/visualizing-neh). If you have any issues with the data or presentation, please [submit issues](https://github.com/GCDigitalFellows/visualizing-neh/issues/new) through Github.
